# You're Not Trash!
You're Not Trash! is a 3D recycling game to help people learn more about environmental conservation.

This is the winning project of the Sustainability Track of StormHacks 2024. I co-developed the frontend and interactions with the Spline game scene.

# Post-POC
1. Improve physics interactions
2. Add levels and garbage objects
